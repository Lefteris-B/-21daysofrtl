## #21daysofrtl [QuickSilicon.in](QuickSilicon.in)

Starting my journey with the #21DaysOfRTL course on QuickSilicon! This free program is perfect for anyone looking to dive into the #100DaysOfRTL trend but unsure where to begin. Over the next 21 days, I'll tackle a series of design problems, gaining practical digital design skills in both RTL and Testbench. From basic 2:1 multiplexers to complex round-robin arbiters, this course covers it all. Excited to build a strong foundation and enhance my RTL design and verification expertise. Letâ€™s get started!
